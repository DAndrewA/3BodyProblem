# 3BodyProblem
Solving a three body problem using physics, python and - hopefully - javascript

The python script is running in python 3.4 using TKinter. Each frame, for every body, it calculates the force on it between all of the other bodies, turns that into a vector and then changes the current vector by the new one. After all of the calculations are done, the bodies are moved - ready for the next frame.
